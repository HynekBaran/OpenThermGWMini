## OpenTherm boiler hardware interface


HW interface connecting the boiler and Arduino (which may act as a thermostat). 
My boiler supports OpenTherm/Light (OT/-) protocol only and this is the only protocol I tested. 
As far as I know, hw (physical "electric" layer) specs of OT- and OT+ (2.0) are the same.
